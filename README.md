## AI Solution Development Project
The objective of this project is to develop an end-to-end AI solution deployed within a Kubernetes environment. This includes data preprocessing, model training, model optimization, and model inference. The solution should be containerized, orchestrated, and optimized for production deployment, integrating best practices in MLOps.
