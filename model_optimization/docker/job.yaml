# This YAML defines a Kubernetes Job that runs model optimization.
# A Job (instead of a Deployment) is used because:
# - The model optimization process only needs to run once.
# - The optimized model is stored in persistent volume (PV), so it doesnâ€™t need to keep running.
# - Kubernetes ensures completion, and failed jobs retry up to 3 times for reliability.
# - The Job automatically stops after execution, reducing resource usage.
